Implementation of combinational logic gates
 
## AIM:
To implement the given logic function verify its operation in Quartus using Verilog programming.
 F1= A’B’C’D’+AC’D’+B’CD’+A’BCD+BC’D
F2=xy’z+x’y’z+w’xy+wx’y+wxy
 
 
 
## Equipments Required:

## Hardware – PCs, Cyclone II , USB flasher
## Software – Quartus prime


## Theory
Logic gates are electronic circuits which performs logical function on one or more inputs to produce one output.

Logic gates are electronic circuits which perform logical function one one or more inputs to produce one output. F1= A’B’C’D’+AC’D’+B’CD’+A’BCD+BC’D
F2=xy’z+x’y’z+w’xy+wx’y+wxy

1.AND gate The And gate is an electronic circuit that given a high output(1) only if all its inputs are high. A dot(.) is used to show the AND operation i.e.A.B or can written as AB Y=A.B

2.OR gate The OR gate is an electronic circuit that gives a high output(1) if one or more of its inputs are high. A plus(+) is used to show the OR operation. Y=A+B
